# Community-Detection-Zachary-Datasets
Explore community structures in complex networks using Zachary Datasets. Our repository employs FAST GREEDY and LABEL PROPAGATION algorithms to identify influential nodes, offering insights into network organization.

Explore the fascinating realm of community detection in complex networks through our repository. Leveraging the renowned Zachary Datasets, we have employed two powerful algorithms – the FAST GREEDY Algorithm and the LABEL PROPAGATION Algorithm – to uncover hidden structures and communities within these networks.

Our project focuses on identifying and defining influential nodes within these communities, shedding light on the key players that drive network dynamics and interactions. Through meticulous analysis and algorithmic approaches, we aim to provide insights into the underlying organization and connectivity patterns of complex networks.

Join us in unraveling the intricate web of relationships within complex networks and understanding the fundamental principles that govern their behavior. Through our repository, we offer access to datasets, code implementations, and findings, fostering collaboration and exploration in the realm of network science.
